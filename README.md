# Image Models and Diffusion in JAX

This is a coding exercise in implementing image models and diffusion in JAX.

**Note:** This is a work in development; for educational purposes only.

**Note:** I am new to JAX, 
diffusion, and image models.

Using JAX from: [https://github.com/jax-ml/jax](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax).


## Installation Instructions

First:

```
conda create -n jax python anaconda
```

Second, for NVIDIA GPUs:
